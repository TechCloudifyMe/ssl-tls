# ssl-tls

An SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate is a digital certificate that establishes a secure and encrypted connection
 between a web browser and a web server. 
 
Until now, pod is exposed using Ingress, but the connection is over HTTP and therefore it is unencrypted. 
Letâ€™s add some security to the server. First,
 create certifiates using openssl, then create kubernetes Secret of type ssl. And finally utilize it in Ingress resource.
